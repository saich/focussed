Focussed
===============

A Google Chrome extension that helps you stay focussed on the content that matter. Reduces the opacity of the non-important content automatically to keep you away from distractions.

Fair Warning
----------------
This extension is very much in the very initial stage, and may unfocus some important content also! To toggle the focussed's functionality on such pages, press "Ctrl+~"

This extension will decently work fine atleast on:
