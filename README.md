# Focussed

**Deprecated. Functionality of this extension is merged into [saich/userscripts](https://github.com/saich/userscripts), especially into techcrunch.user.js and wikipedia.user.js files in the repository.**

A Google Chrome extension that helps you stay focussed on the content that matter. Reduces the opacity of the non-important content automatically to keep you away from distractions.

### Fair Warning

This extension is very much in the very initial stage, and may unfocus some important content also! To toggle the focussed's functionality on such pages, press "Ctrl+~"

This extension will decently work fine atleast on:
- http://www.techcrunch.com/
- http://en.wikipedia.org/
